### Hi, I'm Vivian Birungi ðŸ‘‹

Pronouns: She/Her.
I am a final year student in Creative Computing (BSc Hons) in IADT. I am interested in UX design and have experience in various coding languages such as HTML, CSS, PHP, Python and JavaScript. I am currently working on  creating a Text to Speech application that aims to help all users and I am using JavaScript for this project. A fun fact about me is that I once won a juggling competition when I was younger.
