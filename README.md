### Hi, I'm Vivian Birungi ðŸ‘‹

Pronouns: She/Her.
I am a final year student in Creative Computing (BSc Hons) in IADT. I am interested in UX design and have experience in various coding languages such as HTML, CSS, PHP, Python and JavaScript. I am currently working on  creating a Text to Speech application that aims to help all users and I am using JavaScript for this project. A fun fact about me is that I once won a juggling competition when I was younger.

### Projects
The Text to Speech project is a recent project I am working on for my final year project. It is a UX focused project with a look at building a working application also using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The premise is to allow users to have text translated into speech and giving the user more control on changing the interface. It aims to help all users and particularly users with learning or visual impairments. It is currently a website application but I hope to expand it into a mobile application also. A number of user research was carried out to make the beginnings of this project possible

The Interactive Graphics project was a project that took a look at building a Covid-19 simulation using p5js. The covid simulation was built using real life data from 2021 that was converted into a small visual sample.

The Spotify Recommender System uses a Nearest Neighbour algorithm to predict songs to users based on what they are looking for. This project was created using Python as a focus on learning more about machine learning and how they impact our daily lives.
